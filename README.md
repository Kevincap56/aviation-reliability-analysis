Analysis of aircraft reliability and operational delays using BTS and FAA data.
Commercial Aviation Reliability & Delay Analysis

Overview As an Aeronautical Engineer, I analyzed +500k flights to determine the correlation between aircraft age, manufacturer, and operational efficiency. The goal was to identify if older fleets actually cause more technical delays.

Key Findings

The "Regional" Factor: Regional jets (CRJ Series) showed 80% higher average carrier delays compared to mainline fleets (Boeing 737/Airbus A320).

Age Impact: Aircraft lose operational "immunity" after year 4, stabilizing at ~25 mins of delay per flight.

Total Impact: 22.34% of analyzed flights experienced delays >15 mins.

Tools Used

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures (CALCULATE, TIME INTELLIGENCE), and dashboard design.

Data Sources: BTS (Flight Data) & FAA Releasable Aircraft Database (Fleet Data).

Techniques: ETL processes, Many-to-One relationships, Data Cleaning.
